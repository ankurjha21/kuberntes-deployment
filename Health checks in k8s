Health Checks came in to the picture when we have a issue with pods ,pods are hanging or some kind of  bugs

K8s has two types of health checks to ascertain two different things -;

Readiness Probes;-To determine when  a pods is ready (check everything like when its ready and 
                  has loaded what it needs  to internally  in the image and is ready to take the 
                  request from external services or not
                  
Liveness Probes :- To determine when a pod is healthy or unhelathy after it become ready 

How to do health checks -
                          Add the below line on deployment file in the spec section 
                     
                     - containerPort: 8080
                     livenessProbe:
                       httpGet:
                        path: /
                        Port: 8080
                       initialDelayseconds: 30
                       periodSeconds: 30
                      readinessProbe:
                        httpGet:
                         path: /
                         Port: 8080 # once it is ready it will acess port  8080 on every 3 sec  having delay of 15 sec
                        initialDelayseconds: 15 # if access is ok then pod is healthy otherwise unhealthy
                        periodSeconds: 3
                         
                         
                Run kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml   # for applying the changes we made on deployment file
                 
                kubetcl describe pod name               #for checking the health checks
