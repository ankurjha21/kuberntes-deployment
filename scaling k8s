scalling is depend on the type of application i.e stateful vs stateless application

stateless app is an application program that does not save client data generated in one session for use in the next session with that client. ... 
Stateful application saves data about each client session and uses that data the next time the client makes a request

Replicas alows you to define the number of replica set when you deploy an application  on deployment file 
 setting replica in your deployment recommended

kubectl scale --replicas=4 deployment/tomcat-deployment
 o/p scaled
 kubectl get deployments will show 4 replicas for this tomcat 


how replica will work for that we need to update tyhe service file also this work is to be done by load balencer
 kubectl expose deployment tomcat-deployment --type = loadbalencer --port=8080 --target-port=8080 --name tomcat-load-balencer

kubectl describe services tomcat-load-balancer
