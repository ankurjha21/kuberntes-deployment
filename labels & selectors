Labels
It is the method of organizing and identifying the resources to act upon
It is a key value pairs which we can attach to objects like pods
Labels are for users to help and describe meaningful information about object(POD)

we can label nearly anything in the k8s world like Deployment,Services,Nodes

Eg- We are using the lebels to label a node that it has SSD storage and then use a selector to tell the deployment that our
    that our app should only ever go onto a node with SSd storage
    For this exam we are using node selector
   To accomplish our goal of running our deployment only on nodes with SSD we will ;-
   Label a node as SSD
   Define the node selctor on our deployment  to match only that node which have the label we just defined
    
    kubectl label node nodename storageType=ssd
    o/p node nodename lanbelled
    
    Add this line at the end of deployment file 
    nodeselctor:
      storageType: ssd
      
     run the kubectl apply f deployment.yaml (applying the changes)
     
     
    

Selectors
Its the way of expressing how to select objects based on their labels
We can specify the labels on following criteria -
Equality based
set based


Node selctor is a property on a deployment that useslabels and 
selectors to choose which nodes the master decides to run a  given pod
